## Architecture

### High-Level Overview

![Podcastr Architecture](podcastr-architecture.png)

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Frontend/UI] --> B[API Layer/Route Handlers]
    B --> C[Convex Backend]
    C --> D[Database]
    C --> E[File Storage]
```

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Backend**: Convex
- **Storage**: Convex File Storage
- **Authentication**: Clerk
- **Database**: Convex Database

## How It Works

### 1. Form Submission Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    User->>Frontend: Submits form
    Frontend->>Convex: Mutation call
    Convex->>Storage: Store files
    Convex->>Database: Save metadata
    Convex->>Frontend: Return response
```

### 2. Data Processing Flow

1. User inputs are validated on the client-side
2. Form data is sent to Convex mutation functions
3. Backend processes the request and stores data
4. Response is returned to the frontend
5. UI updates with success/error state

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Run unit tests with:

```bash
npm run test
```

### Integration Tests

Run integration tests with:

```bash
npm run test:integration
```

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Form validation works
- [ ] File uploads complete successfully
- [ ] Data appears in dashboard
- [ ] Search functionality returns expected results
- [ ] Analytics display correctly

## Development Guidelines

1. Always validate inputs both client and server-side
2. Use TypeScript for type safety
3. Follow the established folder structure:
   ```
   /components    # Reusable UI components
   /app          # Pages and routes
   /convex       # Backend functions
   /lib          # Utility functions
   /types        # TypeScript types
   ```

## Error Handling

- Client-side validation using Zod
- Server-side validation in Convex functions
- Proper error messages displayed to users
- Error logging and monitoring

## Performance Considerations

- Optimize file uploads
- Use proper caching strategies
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Monitor Convex function execution time
